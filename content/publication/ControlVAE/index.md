abstract: "In this paper, we introduce ControlVAE, a novel model-based framework
for learning generative motion control policies based on variational autoencoders (VAE). Our framework can learn a rich and flexible latent representation of skills and a skill-conditioned generative control policy from a
diverse set of unorganized motion sequences, which enables the generation
of realistic human behaviors by sampling in the latent space and allows
high-level control policies to reuse the learned skills to accomplish a variety
of downstream tasks. In the training of ControlVAE, we employ a learnable
world model to realize direct supervision of the latent space and the control
policy. This world model effectively captures the unknown dynamics of the
simulation system, enabling efficient model-based learning of high-level
downstream tasks. We also learn a state-conditional prior distribution in the
VAE-based generative control policy, which generates a skill embedding that
outperforms the non-conditional priors in downstream tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ControlVAE using a diverse set of tasks, which
allows realistic and interactive control of the simulated characters.
